# Verification & Testing

> **MANDATORY: Task tracking.** Before starting verification, create a task for each step below (Steps 1–6) using `TaskCreate`. Mark each task `in_progress` when you start it and `completed` when you finish it. Do not skip steps. If a step cannot be completed, stop and ask the user — do not silently move on. A config is not complete until every task is marked completed.

After `moveit_pro run` reaches `You can start planning now!`, verify the config systematically before considering it complete. Do not skip these steps — a config that launches is not necessarily a config that works.

All verification commands run inside the Docker container via `docker exec`. Which container to use depends on the command:
- **drivers** (`moveit_pro-drivers-1`): Controller queries (`ros2 control list_controllers`), joint state echo, hardware-level checks
- **agent_bridge** (`moveit_pro-agent_bridge-1`): Objective execution (`ros2 action send_goal /do_objective ...`), action server queries, move_group checks

Both containers need environment setup (CycloneDDS, workspace sourcing) before ROS 2 CLI commands will work.

**Important:** Do NOT use `docker compose exec` — it requires the correct project context and will fail with "service has neither an image nor a build context" if run from your workspace directory. MoveIt Pro runs as the `moveit_pro` compose project, but your workspace only has an override file. Use `docker exec` with explicit container names (`moveit_pro-drivers-1`, `moveit_pro-agent_bridge-1`) instead.

**Important: Restart the ROS2 daemon before running CLI commands.** CycloneDDS discovery over localhost does not work for new CLI processes unless the daemon is restarted. Run this once per container session before any other `ros2` commands:

```bash
docker exec -u <username> moveit_pro-drivers-1 bash -c "\
  export CYCLONEDDS_URI=/home/<username>/.ros/cyclonedds.xml && \
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp && \
  source /opt/overlay_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  source /home/<username>/user_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  ros2 daemon stop && ros2 daemon start"
```

Replace `<username>` with the user configured in your Dockerfile (default `moveit-pro-user`, or your host username if customized). After the daemon restart, subsequent commands in the same container will discover topics correctly.

For all verification commands below, prefix with the environment setup:
```bash
docker exec -u <username> moveit_pro-drivers-1 bash -c "\
  export CYCLONEDDS_URI=/home/<username>/.ros/cyclonedds.xml && \
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp && \
  source /opt/overlay_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  source /home/<username>/user_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  <command>"
```

### Step 1: Verify Controllers Loaded

Check that all expected controllers are loaded and in the correct state:

```bash
docker exec -u <username> moveit_pro-drivers-1 bash -c "\
  export CYCLONEDDS_URI=/home/<username>/.ros/cyclonedds.xml && \
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp && \
  source /opt/overlay_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  source /home/<username>/user_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  ros2 control list_controllers"
```

Expected output should show:
- `joint_state_broadcaster` — **active**
- `joint_trajectory_admittance_controller` — **active**
- `robotiq_gripper_controller` (or your end effector controller) — **active**
- `joint_velocity_controller` — **inactive** (activated on demand for joint teleop)
- `velocity_force_controller` — **inactive** (activated on demand for pose teleop)

If any controller is missing, check the ros2_control yaml and config.yaml `controllers_active/inactive_at_startup` lists.

### Step 2: Verify Joint States

Confirm the robot is publishing joint states and the joint names match your config:

```bash
docker exec -u <username> moveit_pro-drivers-1 bash -c "\
  export CYCLONEDDS_URI=/home/<username>/.ros/cyclonedds.xml && \
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp && \
  source /opt/overlay_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  source /home/<username>/user_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  ros2 topic echo /joint_states --once"
```

Verify:
- All expected arm joints appear in the `name` list
- End effector joints (if any) appear
- Position values match your expected home/initial pose
- The topic is publishing (not hanging)

### Step 3: Run a Test Objective

Run the simplest objective to verify the behavior tree execution pipeline works. Use "Move to Home" as the universal first test (every config should have this):

```bash
docker exec -u <username> moveit_pro-agent_bridge-1 bash -c "\
  export CYCLONEDDS_URI=/home/<username>/.ros/cyclonedds.xml && \
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp && \
  source /opt/overlay_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  source /home/<username>/user_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  ros2 action send_goal /do_objective \
  moveit_studio_sdk_msgs/action/DoObjectiveSequence \
  '{objective_name: \"Move to Home\"}'"
```

**Note:** Objectives run via the `agent_bridge` container (where the objective server lives), not `drivers`.

If your config has end effector objectives (Open/Close Gripper, Activate/Deactivate Vacuum, etc.), test those too. If these succeed, the objective server, controller manager, and controllers are all working together.

### Step 4: Test Teleop (Joint Jog)

Joint jog is the simplest teleop mode and should work for any config with a `joint_velocity_controller`:

1. Open the MoveIt Pro web UI (http://localhost)
2. Select the **Teleop** tab
3. Choose **Joint Jog** mode
4. Try moving each joint individually

If joint jog fails:
- Check that `joint_velocity_controller` loaded (Step 1)
- Verify `joint_jog.yaml` has `controllers: ['joint_velocity_controller']`
- Check logs for controller switching errors

### Step 5: Visual Inspection

Use the Playwright screenshot tool to capture the MoveIt Pro web UI and visually verify the robot configuration. This allows automated verification without requiring a human to open a browser.

**Capture a screenshot:**
```bash
cd <path_to>/ui_testing && node capture.js --output /tmp/moveit_pro_ui.png --wait 8000
```

Then read the screenshot image and verify:

1. **End effector orientation**: If using a gripper, the fingers should point **away** from the arm. If they point toward the wrist, the mounting rotation is wrong.
2. **No gaps or overlaps**: The end effector base should sit flush against the arm's tool flange. A gap means the Z offset is too large; overlap means too small or missing.
3. **Home pose looks reasonable**: The robot should not be in a fully extended or obviously impossible pose.
4. **No collision warnings**: Check the UI for toast error messages. The capture script also collects visible toast/alert elements.
5. **Robot is visible**: If the 3D view is empty or shows only a grid, the URDF failed to load — check the logs.

**Capture after running an objective** to verify motion:
```bash
# Run an objective first
docker exec -u <username> moveit_pro-drivers-1 bash -c "... ros2 action send_goal /do_objective ..."
# Then capture the result
node capture.js --output /tmp/after_move.png --wait 3000
```

If a human is available, ask them to also verify visually and test IMarker teleop (drag-and-drop in the 3D view), which cannot be automated with Playwright.

### Step 6: Test Motion Planning

Try planning and executing a motion to verify the full pipeline:

```bash
docker exec -u <username> moveit_pro-agent_bridge-1 bash -c "\
  export CYCLONEDDS_URI=/home/<username>/.ros/cyclonedds.xml && \
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp && \
  source /opt/overlay_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  source /home/<username>/user_ws/install/setup.bash && \
  ros2 action send_goal --feedback /do_objective \
  moveit_studio_sdk_msgs/action/DoObjectiveSequence \
  \"{objective_name: 'Move to Waypoint'}\""
```

Or use the web UI to drag the interactive marker and plan a motion. If planning fails:
- Check kinematics.yaml uses `pose_ik_plugin/PoseIKPlugin`
- Verify the manipulator chain in the SRDF is correct (base_link to tip_link)
- Check joint limits in joint_limits.yaml match the URDF

### Verification Complete

When all Steps 1–6 above are marked as completed tasks, the config is verified. If any step was skipped or could not be completed, the config is NOT verified — flag it to the user.
